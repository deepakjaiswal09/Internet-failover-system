# Internet Failover System

## Overview

In todayâ€™s world, continuous internet connectivity is essential for both personal and professional use. However, relying on a single internet connection can lead to frustrating downtime due to outages, weak signals, or network issues.

This **Internet Failover System** automatically monitors the internet connection status and seamlessly switches between multiple network interfaces (e.g., Wi-Fi, Mobile Hotspot) to maintain uninterrupted connectivity.

## Why This System?

- **Unreliable Single Connections:** Many existing setups rely on one primary internet source. When it fails, manual switching or downtime occurs.
- **High Latency & Delays:** Older failover methods often have significant delays in detecting outages and switching to backup networks.
- **Manual Intervention:** Many systems require user action to switch networks, causing productivity loss and user frustration.

## What Our System Overcomes

- **Automatic and Fast Failover:** Detects internet outages quickly and switches automatically to backup networks, minimizing downtime.
- **Multiple Backup Options:** Supports a prioritized list of backup networks, increasing chances of staying online.
- **Seamless Switching:** Disconnects from failed networks and connects to healthy alternatives without user intervention.
- **Lightweight and Extensible:** Built with modular Python components, easy to customize or extend for different environments or interfaces.
